# Streaming-Finance-Data-with-AWS-Lambda

In this project, I create a Kinesis Delivery Stream. Then I write a Lambda function that is triggered every 5 minutes. 
On trigger, it will grab stock price data and place it into the delivery defined in the DataTransformer. 
Finally, I configured AWS Glue, pointing it to the S3 Bucket I created in DataCollector.
This will allow us to now interactively query the S3 files generated by the DataTransformer using AWS Athena to gain insight into our streamed data. 
## Technology used
Amazon kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, 


## Data Transformation
In the collector, yfinanced was used to grab stock information.
I collected one full day’s worth of stock HIGH and LOW prices for each company listed above on Tuesday, November 30th 2021, at a five minute interval.

## Data Analysis
Lastly, I set up a Glue crawler so that I can run AWS Athena queries against data. 
Then, in Athena, write and run a query that gives us the highest hourly stock “high” per company from the list above.
